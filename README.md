# Problem Statement
Diagnosing pneumonia in a CXR accurately is difficult. Expert radiologists are required to review the CXR and also require confirmation through clinical examinations. You are tasked to classify CXRs with pneumonia from their normal CXR counterparts, using machine learning and computer vision techniques.
